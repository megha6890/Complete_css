            Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)
            Description: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)
            Process: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first, second, third. (See an example.)
            Classification: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (See an example.)
            Illustration: Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step process below.)
